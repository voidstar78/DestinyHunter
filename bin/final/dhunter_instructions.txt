Destiny Hunter is an adventure story
game that was designed to be self-
contained (needing no external files
loaded from disk), thus limited to 32K.

- DHUNTERPET.PRG can be loaded and ran
  by VICE or similar emulator, or drag
  and drop into PET 2001 emulator at
  https://www.masswerk.at/pet/

- DHUNTERPET.PRG can also be ran on 
  physical Commodore PET; using SD
  adapter or obtain a disk or TAPE copy,
  then use "LOAD" or "DLOAD" commands.

- DHUNTERC64.PRG is the Commodore 64
  build, which by intent is equivalent
  to the PET version except for the
  addition of COLOR!

- DHUNTERA2 is the Apple ][ build,
  which is nearly equivalent but some
  adjustments were necessary due to
  only having 24 rows instead of 25
  (and that the Apple ][ has no 
  native built-in real time clock).

- DHUNTERA2.DSK is an Apple ][
  pre-built Disk Image, which may
  be easier to load for some
  emulators (prepared using 
  AppleCommander).

- DHUNTER8032.PRG is an 8032
  compatible build (80-column wide
  and new numeric keypad codes).

- DHUNTER.M3 is the TRS-80
  Model 3 binary build.

- DHUNTER.COM is the IBM PC 5150
  binary build (can work with 
  PC-DOS 1.0 to MS-DOS 7).

- DHUNTER180.img is a PC-DOS 180K
  disk image, that may be easier to 
  use by some emulators. Should be 
  PC-DOS 2.10 compatible.


When you start the game...

- Press SPACEBAR (or any key) a few
  times to prepare your character.
  During this time, you may receive
  BLESSING or PERSISTENCY that can
  help you from the beginning.

  BLESSINGS slow the CHALLENGES,
  PERSISTENCY recovers your HEALTH.

  Keep pressing a key until prompted
  to press RETURN.

  NOTE: This process is initializing
  the seed for the RNG.

- Press RETURN to pass the CHIMES
  creation section.  This RETURN
  is important, since internally
  the program uses the keycode
  observed to decide 20XX/30XX vs
  40XX PET keycodes to use.

- Next, select a PERSONA by pressing
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.   I suggest new 
  players use SIDON or RUDRA.  The 
  "normal" difficulty is ALCYONE.
  CYRENE is probably the hardest, for
  more experienced players wanting
  a higher difficulty.

ON C64 version: You can use W/S to
  cycle UP/DOWN thru PERSONAS.

- Press ENTER to proceed with the
  selected PERSONA.

- Next is a brief orientation, about
  controls and map terrain symbols.

- Once you begin, the game is like the
  TOP-DOWN style of original ZELDA.

- You start "empty handed" on an island.
  Your first objective is to obtain
  the BOW (")") and ARROW (up-pointing
  arrow) that randomly placed on the
  BEACH (so they will be slightly 
  different location each time).

- Once you have the BOW and ARROW, the
  adventure begins:  CHALLENGES will
  appear that must be defeated by use
  of the BOW and ARROW.

- You can't just shoot in any direction!
  You must AIM your BOW, using the 
  AIM LEFT and AIM RIGHT buttons.  And
  it can take time to AIM and MOVE,
  so you really must "hunt" the 
  CHALLENGES and try to anticipate their
  movements!

- As soon as you pick up the BOW and
  ARROW, two CHALLENGES will appear. 
  They are rats and are fairly easy
  to defeat, this is to help introduce 
  the gameplay.   AIM and HIT them a few 
  times to defeat them both with ARROWS.

- If you run out of ARROWS, more will
  spawn (look for the UP ARROW).
  If you defeat a CHALLENGE, move
  to where it was defeated to 
  collect back some ARROWS.

- When you move and shoot, there is an
  energy cost called STAMINA.  So
  be patient about your movement, and
  avoid WATER as it will cost more 
  energy to move while in WATER.

- The remaining HEALTH of the CHALLENGE
  that you last hit is at the top right
  near the STAGE name, so you can use 
  this to know how close you are to
  defeating a CHALLENGE.

- Once all the CHALLENGES of a STAGE 
  have been defeated, a notice will 
  appear that you can press "F" to
  FINISH the STAGE (and proceed to the
  next one).  Before doing so, you can
  collect any arrows or explore for
  hidden things!


COMBAT SYSTEM
=============

- CHALLENGES have no range attack,
  and can only attack when you are
  next to them (on any side).  However,
  CHALLENGES will "chase" you based
  on your STEALTH.  So you may need
  to run away, and work a balance
  between STAMINA and FIRING RANGE.

- While CHALLENGES can chase you,
  they can also "give up" on the chase
  and go back to their patrol or
  loitering condition.

- The CHALLENGE ability to HIT when
  next to you is based on your DEFENSE
  (agility to dodge, etc).

- If you do get HIT, the screen will
  "flicker" and you lose 1 HP.  Use
  PERSISTENCY to recover.

- Your BOW and ARROW is the only means
  to defeat CHALLENGES.  Your precision
  to hit is based on ATTACK, so it is
  possible to MISS.  

- If you do HIT a CHALLENGE, a number
  at the top right next to the STAGE
  name will show how much HEALTH that
  CHALLENGE has remaining.


SCREEN LAYOUT
=============
The STAGE has an OVERLAY with some
useful information at the top and bottom:

- TOP LEFT: Items and Skills acquired.
  e.g. BOW (, ORB, FLIP, GEM, BOOK.

- TOP RIGHT: CHALLENGE health and 
  STAGE name

- TOP CENTER: Chosen PERSONA name.


- BOTTOM LEFT: BLESSING count (B)

- BOTTOM RIGHT: PERSISTENCY (0 or K)

- BOTTOM CENTER: Your ARROWS and HEALTH 
  remaining.



KEY CONTROLS
============

PET VERSION:

  WASD   movement UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT
         can only move when have
         STAMINA and not in REST mode.

  4/6    AIM bow LEFT/RIGHT
         only once you have the BOW

  8      Becomes the FLIP SKILL once
         you have enough experience
         to perform the FLIP (afer 
         about 200 steps).  Use this
         to quickly rotate the BOW 
         by 180 degrees! (a FLIP!)

  O      Activate the Orb!  But finding
         the orb is part of the 
         adventure.  It remains active
         for one STAGE only! And is a
         mystery on what the ORB does!

  B      Use a BLESSING (slows down
         CHALLENGES)

  0      On the NUMBER PAD, intent is
         using your thumb to invoke
         PERSISTENCY (cost 1 PERSISTENCY  
         to increase your HP by 1).
         Defeating CHALLENGES also
         increases your PERSISTENCY.
  
  F      FINISH stage and go to next 
         one (once all CHALLENGES are
         defeated).

  SPACE  Fire an arrow in the direction
         you are AIMED at.  Only one
         arrow at a time (as it takes
         time to reload an arrow).


C64 VERSION:

  Since C64 has no NUMBER PAD, a 
  slightly different set of controls
  is necessary...

  WASD    movement  (same)

  J/L     AIM left/right

  I       FLIP SKILL
  K       Use PERSISTENCY

  O       Activate ORB
  B       Use a BLESSING

  F       FINISH stage

  SPACE   Fire arrow in current
          aim direction
